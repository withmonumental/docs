A code of conduct is a critical document that outlines the expected behavior of all community members, including individuals and organizations who engage with the Monumenal platform. The following are some ways to improve the existing code of conduct:

## Introduction
The introduction should provide a clear definition of what a code of conduct is and why it's essential to have one in place. Here's an example:

::: info Definition
A code of conduct is a set of guidelines that outlines the norms, rules, and responsibilities of individuals and organizations who engage with the Monumental platform. This document is crucial to maintaining a safe, respectful, and inclusive community that values diversity and encourages civil discourse."
::: 

## Tone and Language
The tone and language of the code of conduct should be professional, respectful, and inclusive. Avoid using colloquial language or jokes that may be interpreted as inappropriate. Here's an example of how to improve the tone and language:

> Monumental is committed to maintaining a safe, respectful, and inclusive community that values diversity and encourages civil discourse. We believe that everyone has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, and we expect all community members to uphold these values."

## Clarity and Specificity
The code of conduct should be clear, concise, and specific. Avoid using vague language or general statements that may be open to interpretation. Here's an example of how to improve clarity and specificity:

**For all members:**

- Treat all members of the community with respect, regardless of their race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or background.
- If problems arise, talk to each other first and try to come to an understanding.
- Do not threaten or attack any community member or member of the KO team.
- Wash trading, price exploitation, or manipulation will not be tolerated.
- Be inclusive, non-judgmental, and polite - civil discussion should be possible without attacking each other on a personal level.
- Flag scams, fakes, and other problems to the wider community to get them resolved as quickly as possible.

**For creatives:**

- Ensure you always credit your artworks where applicable.
- Ensure your artworks are always unique on the Monumental platform.
- Seek permission to use someone else's work - remixes/collages can be great, but often, artists prefer to be consulted.
- Ensure your creations do not infringe copyright or other intellectual materials, including audio.
- Seek permission to add someone as a collaborator when making collaborative work.

**For Monumental Team :**

- We will not give preferential treatment to anyone and will treat everyone equally.
- We will try to resolve all problems as quickly as possible and in a timely fashion.
- We will try to help all community members when problems arise.
- Be transparent with what we are working on.
- Maintain open communications on Discord and our community calls.
- Ensure all smart contract code is open-sourced.
- We will never ask anyone for a private key, password, or any type of cryptocurrency.

If you notice any behaviors that violate our code of conduct, please bring them to our attention. We will hold those accountable for their actions.

In summary, the code of conduct should clearly define the expected behavior of all community members in a professional and respectful tone. It should be specific, concise, and free of vague language or general statements. With these improvements, the Monumental community will be better equipped to maintain a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment.
