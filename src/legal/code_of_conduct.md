## Clarity and Specificity

**For all members:**

1. Respect all members of the community: Show respect for all members of the community, regardless of their race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or background. Treat everyone as you would like to be treated.
2. Communicate respectfully: If you encounter problems or disagreements within the community, try to communicate respectfully with other members first, in order to find a solution together. Respectful communication and understanding can help to resolve conflicts and build stronger relationships.
3. Avoid threatening or attacking others: It is not acceptable to threaten or attack any member of the community or any member of the Monumental team. Respectful communication is key to creating a welcoming and safe environment for everyone.
4. Avoid market manipulation: Wash trading, price exploitation, or manipulation are not tolerated on the platform. These actions undermine the integrity of the marketplace and harm the community as a whole.
5. Encourage inclusivity and civility: Encourage inclusivity and non-judgmental behavior by engaging in civil discussions without attacking others on a personal level. In this way, everyone can feel welcome and safe to participate in the community.
6. Report problems: If you encounter scams, fakes, or other problems within the community, flag them to the wider community to get them resolved as quickly as possible. By working together, the community can help to keep the platform safe and secure for all users.

**For artists and collectors:**

1. Give credit where credit is due: Whenever you use someone else's artwork, make sure to credit the original creator. This includes images, videos, music, and other forms of art. Provide attribution to the artist and include a link to their work if possible.
2. Create original content: Always strive to create unique and original artwork on the Monumental platform. While inspiration can come from many sources, it's important to create something that is truly your own.
3. Obtain permission to use others' work: If you want to use someone else's work, such as in a remix or collage, always seek their permission first. Many artists appreciate being consulted and may have specific requirements for how their work can be used.
4. Respect intellectual property: Make sure your creations do not infringe on copyright or other intellectual property rights, including audio. Research and obtain any necessary licenses or permissions before using someone else's work.

Seek permission for collaboration: When collaborating with others, seek their permission before adding them as a collaborator. This helps ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the collaboration is a success. Additionally, make sure to credit all collaborators for their contributions to the project.
