In the event that an artwork does not meet the artistic criteria of a space or the artwork’s ownership has not been verified or a disagreement occurs between the space manager and the artist or collector, the space manager has the option to ban the artwork from his space. By banning an artwork will result in the artwork is no more visible on the Platform. 
At any times a ban can be reversed by the space manager.

::: warning Important
The ban can only be done when an artwork is not on sale. 
To ensure a complete ban on a space for a limited edition, the space manager will need to unpublish all existing space contracts linked to each edition on his space.
