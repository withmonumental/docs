In its current version on the Ethereum MainNet, the Monumental platform guarantees that a creator receives a portion of the profits from any future sales of his art, in other words Monumental guarantees that an artist will gain his desired royalties from any future sales of his work.<br>
Early this year, a new governing mechanism has been implemented by the Creator Ownership Research Institute (CORI) for enforcing and protecting creator royalties in the NFT ecosystem. This standard tool is called the Operator Filter Registry.<br>
This tool acts as a blocklist and is designed to allow token smart contracts to register themselves or be registered by their respective “owner”. The token contracts may then curate list of account addresses and other smart contracts that are not allowed to transfer tokens on behalf of users. <br>
In a very near future Monumental’s ambition is to join CORI and be registered within its Operator Filter Registry to be recognised as an official platform that does respect and defend creator royalties.
