Space’s goal is to elevate the visibility and financial success of the artists they
support.
Artist and collector on the platform can sale their own artwork or collection on the first
or second market. Those items need however to be first published on a space in
order to be visible and sold.
This process is called **subscription**. You can subscribe as a Member or as a guest.
By subscribing, a space contract is generated. This space contract is a business
relationship between a seller and the space. It defines the duration of the relationship
and the commission rate applied to sales on the first or second market.
Important Notice
In the event that the artist or collector wishes to unpublish their work(s) before the
contract&#39;s expiration (due to disagreement with the space or simply to respect the
right to be forgotten), the platform offers the &quot;Publish/Unpublish&quot; function. This
function is also available to both side of the business relationship, the space or the
artist/collector.
This guide is intending to explain how subscription are initiated on the platform
Monumental.
