## Publishing artwork on Monumental

### Artwork creation
By creating a new artwork on Monumental,  ==??==
For a **standard edition**, your artwork is by default not visible to anyone on the Platform. As an artist and owner of your artwork you will be the only person to see your new creation.
For a **community edition**, your artwork is by default visible to everyone on the Platform, (your artwork will be displayed on the portal page under the section **JUST LANDED**) since when you created your artwork you selected the space where your community edition should be submitted.
In both cases you will be able to find you artwork under your personal space:


```mermaid

    id1(Your profile icon)-->id2(personal space)-->id3(Created)
```

Once your artwork has been submitted and approved to a space, it will be published meaning that it will be visible to everyone on the Platform.

::: info Note
For more information about subscription, please refer to the section **Space Subscription**.
If you decide that you are not yet ready to show your artwork, you have the possibility to unpublish your artwork or to make invisible. This is the right to be forgotten.
:::

To do this:
1. Click on your artwork
2. You will be directed to the detailed view of the artwork
3. Under the section **Spaces**, a list of spaces indicates where your token (artwork) is published. This is represented by the blue colour of the slide button. If no slide button appears this means that your artwork has not been primarily submitted to a space.
4. Select form the list the token you desired to unpublish from a space 
5. Disable the slide button (grey colour= unpublish) 
6. Under the section **Editions** the space icon linked to your token disappears
7. This confirms that your token is no more visible on the space where you decided to unpublish it

::: info Note
If your artwork is not published in any space you will not be able to produce a sale of your artwork.
To simply publish the artwork again on the space, enable the slide button under the section **Spaces** of your artwork’s detailed view window. The colour of the slide button is now blue.

```

::: warning Important
Subscription’s inheritance is a crucial theme on Monumental. Whenever an artwork has been sold on a space, by default the new owner of this artwork will have it published on that space. This is to ease the trading on second market. For more information, please refer to **Space Subscription** 
Once your artwork has been submitted and approved to a space, it will be published meaning that it will be visible to everyone on the Platform.
If you decide that you are not yet ready to show your artwork, you have the possibility to unpublish your artwork or to make invisible. This is the right to be forgotten.
