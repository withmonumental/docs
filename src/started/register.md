App Store (iOS)

## Getting started

MetaMask offers an on-screen setup tutorial for all supported browsers. Follow the instructions, read the terms, and click "I Agree" to start the setup process.

To create a wallet, click on the "Create a Wallet" button and create a password with at least eight characters. This password will be used to log in to the browser extension or add-on.

The Secret Backup Phrase is a crucial tool for backing up and restoring your account at any time. It is a sequence of 12 words that must be memorized or written down and stored securely. Do not store it on your computer as it could be vulnerable to hacking or theft. Store it on an encrypted hard drive or password manager like 1Password or LastPass.

Confirm your Secret Backup Phrase and click "All Done" once it is securely stored. You have now created a MetaMask wallet and are connected to the Ethereum Mainnet.

To find your Ethereum address in MetaMask, click the MetaMask icon from the toolbar on your browser or launch the app on your mobile device. Your Ethereum address will be displayed under "Account 1" near the top of the window. You can create additional Ethereum addresses by clicking on the circle icon and selecting the "Create Account" option. Simply choose an account name and click "Create." You can toggle between these accounts by clicking on the circle icon.
