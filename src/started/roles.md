## Collector
As a collector, you have the opportunity to display the excellent pieces in your collection to a wider audience through the different available spaces. This platform allows you to highlight the unique qualities of your collection and share your passion for art with others. Additionally, the secondary market provides you with the option to monetize your collection by selling works that you own. Whether you're looking to downsize your collection, upgrade to more valuable pieces, or simply looking to generate some extra income, the secondary market offers you the chance to trade artworks with other collectors and art enthusiasts. So, being a collector not only lets you enjoy and appreciate art, but also gives you the ability to share your collection and potentially make a profit from it.

## Artist
As an artist, you have the possibility to take advantage of digital technology to protect your intellectual property rights. 
By creating a digital certificate, you can ensure that you have evidence of ownership over your art. 
This digital certificate will serve as proof that you are the rightful owner of the art and will guarantee that you receive a portion of the profits from any future sales of the work. 
Additionally, you can still sell some of your art stored in your digital wallet.
However, it is important to note that in order to sell your art, you must first be a subscriber to a space, ensuring that your works are accessible to potential buyers.

## Space Manager

A Monumental Space Manager serves as the space curator and is accountable for the following tasks:

- Inviting artists to become space members or guests via direct invitation from their profile.
- Establishing fees and commissions for each artist's work sales through space contracts.
