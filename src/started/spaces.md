Spaces provide a showcase for exhibiting exceptional art created by handpicked, talented artists. The Space Team partners with these artists and collectors to develop and disseminate engaging content about the art they represent. Their goal is to elevate the visibility and financial success of the artists they support.

> Space acts as an independant seller on the platform

## Space types

The Monumental platform serves three distinct space types:
- **Classic Space** : 
  Expertly managed by seasoned professionals, showcasing curated art collections.
- **Collaborative Space** :
 A collaborative space with the same features as a classic one, but with fees and commissions shared among multiple accounts (space accounts), proportionate to their number.
- **Charity Space** :   
   For those seeking to support a cause, a charity space is available, where fees and commission are directly transferred to charitable wallets, with no commission taken by Monumental.
   

## Space accounts

In a space, an unlimited number of accounts can be defined.
They allow for the allocation of sales-related fees and commissions into dedicated categories, making it easier to track financial transactions.

## Space members

Members of a space are artists or collectors invited by the space manager.
Upon joining, they are assigned one of the following member types:

- Artist
- Artist and Collector
- Collector

This role is crucial as it determines specific access rights for works to be published into the space.


> **Artist**: All types of works are automatically accepted without the need for approval.

> **Artist and Collector**: On the first market, no approval is required. Approval is necessary for the second market.

> **Collector**: Only second market artworks are authorized


## Space Contracts

A space contract is a business relationship between a seller and the space.
It defines the duration of the relationship and the commission rate applied to sales on the first or second market.

### Space contract proposal - initiated by Space

When a space wants to promote an artist or collector, it can create a proposal that includes:

- the relevant work(s)
- the partnership duration
- the commission to be applied

Upon receipt, the artist or collector can then accept or reject the proposal.
In case of acceptance, the work(s) covered by the contract are immediately visible in the space.

### Space contract proposal - initiated by Artist or Collector

When an artist/collector wants to subscribe to a space, it can create a proposal that includes:

- the relevant work(s)
- the partnership duration
- the commission to be applied

Upon receipt, the space can then accept or reject the proposal.
In case of acceptance, the work(s) covered by the contract are immediately visible in the space.


::: danger Important Notice
In the event that the artist or collector wishes to unpublish their work(s) before the contract's expiration (due to disagreement with the space or simply to respect the right to be forgotten), the platform offers the "Publish/Unpublish" function.
This function is also available to both side of the business relationship, the space or the artist/collector.
