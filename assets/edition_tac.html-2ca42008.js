These assets are considered limited-edition digital items and are associated with a digital certificate that verifies their authenticity and ownership.<br><br> To link the Content to a token, the platform uses Smart Contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into the code. Smart Contracts facilitate the creation and management of tokens on the platform.<br><br> However, since the Monumental Platform operates on the Ethereum network, which is a blockchain platform, transactions involving Smart Contracts require the payment of a transaction fee called the &quot;Gas Fee.&quot; Ethereum&#39;s Gas Fee is a mechanism to allocate computational resources and prevent spam or misuse of the network. Each operation or transaction on the Ethereum network, including token creation, requires a certain amount of gas, which is paid for using the cryptocurrency Ether (ETH).<br><br> Therefore, when an artist utilizes a Smart Contract on the Monumental Platform to create a token, they need to pay the Gas Fee in ETH to cover the computational resources required for that transaction to be processed on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee amount can vary depending on the complexity of the transaction and the current network congestion.</p><h3 id="standard-edition" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#standard-edition" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Standard Edition</h3><p>Each time you create a <em>Standard Edition</em> and subsequent edition,, the Monumental Platform utilises a Smart Contract to conduct a digital certificate and a token creation.
